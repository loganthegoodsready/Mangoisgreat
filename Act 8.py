# Lab task 8:
num = 1
for y in range(1,13):
    print(num,"x", y, "=", num*y)


# How to print them in a grid like:

"""
1 x tables   2 x tables   3 x tables   4 x tables

5 x tables   6 x tables   7 x tables   8 x tables

9 x tables   10 x tables   11 x tables   12 x tables

"""

# Need to find out how to do this. Hopefully the answer will come apparent to me as I learn more python.
